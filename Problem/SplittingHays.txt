Farmer John wants to fairly split haybales between his two favorite cows Bessie and Elsie. He has N
 ( 1≤N≤2⋅105
) haybales sorted in non-increasing order, where the i
-th haybale has ai
 units of hay (2⋅105≥a1≥a2≥⋯≥aN≥1
).

Farmer John is considering splitting a contiguous range of haybales al,…,ar
 between Bessie and Elsie. He has decided to process the haybales in order from l
 to r
, and when processing the i
-th haybale he will give it to the cow who currently has less hay (if it is a tie, he will give it to Bessie).

You are given Q
 (1≤Q≤2⋅105
) queries, each with three integers l,r,x
 (1≤l≤r≤N
, |x|≤109
). For each query, output how many more units of hay Bessie will have than Elsie after processing haybales l
 to r
, if Bessie starts with x
 more units than Elsie. Note that this value is negative if Elsie ends up with more haybales than Bessie.
